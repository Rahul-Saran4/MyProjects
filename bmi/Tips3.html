 <h1>For overweight</h1>
 <ul>
    <strong>The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this you should:</strong> 
    <br><br>
        <li> eat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) </li>
        <li> join a local weight loss group</li>
        <li> take up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week</li>
        <li> eat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat</li>
    </ul>
